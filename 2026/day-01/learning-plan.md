Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is a culture and practice that bridges development and operations through automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It focuses on shortening development cycles, increasing deployment frequency, and ensuring reliable releases through CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, and feedback loops.

Cloud Engineering involves designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), leveraging services like compute, storage, networking, and managed solutions to build resilient, cost-effective systems.

Why I'm Learning DevOps & Cloud
To stay current with evolving tools and best practices in the DevOps ecosystem
To build production-grade expertise that delivers measurable business value
To transition from operational tasks to strategic infrastructure design and optimization
To strengthen my ability to architect cloud-native solutions at scale
Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)
Deploy a production-grade microservices application on Kubernetes with auto-scaling, monitoring, and GitOps-based deployments
Build and maintain a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitLab CI with security scanning, testing, and blue-green deployments
Achieve proficiency in Infrastructure as Code by managing multi-environment cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible
Core DevOps Skills to Build
Advanced Kubernetes Management - Pod troubleshooting, networking, security policies, Helm charts, and cluster optimization
CI/CD Pipeline Mastery - Building robust pipelines with automated testing, security gates, artifact management, and deployment strategies
Observability & Incident Response - Setting up comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting with Prometheus/Grafana/ELK, and conducting RCA
